introduction:
  1: >
    Welcome to the MWP experiment! Press the SPACEBAR to begin.
  2: >
    In today's experiment you will answer some simple yes or no questions about
    familiar objects like dogs, chairs, and elephants. Think about it like a game
    you might play with a child who is learning these objects for the first time.
    First you'll hear the question (for example, 'Does it have feathers?'), then
    you'll hear the name of an object, like 'eagle' or 'table'. For most of the
    questions, you will answer the question 'yes' or 'no' with regard to the
    named object. Press the SPACEBAR to hear one of these questions.
  3: >
    Some of the questions may sound a bit weird. If the question doesn't make sense,
    the answer is most likely 'no'. Press the SPACEBAR to hear one of these questions.
  4: >
    Other questions will be true for some items in a category, but not all items.
    In these cases, the answer is 'yes'. Press the SPACEBAR to hear one of these
    questions.
  5: >
    On some of the trials, instead of seeing the prompt that says "Yes or No?"
    you will see a picture of an object. On these trials, instead of answering
    the question, you will instead answer whether or not the picture is the same
    as the named object. Press the SPACEBAR to see one of these trials.
  6: >
    If you see a picture that was *not* named, press the key for 'no'. Press the
    SPACEBAR to see one of these trials.
end_of_practice: >
  You've reached the end of the practice trials.
break_screen: >
  Take a quick break, but please stay in the room.
end_of_experiment: >
  You've finished the experiment. Before you leave, we will ask you to fill out
  a short survey. This survey will appear in a web browser after you press the
  SPACEBAR. If you do not see the survey or have any problems submitting your
  responses, please let the experimenter know. And thanks for participating!
